--------------
I know there isn't much in the game, but if you know about the systems that exist it can be very fun for a short time, here are some secrets.

- Always have a poison antidote in your pocket, poison snipers are very effective. Use the 'A' macro and it will cure you of all poison. Has 5 uses.

- There are ventilation systems to sneak in/out/through a base.

- There are rooftops to snipe from.

- Stand behind somebody and face their back, press 'G' and you will grab them. You have approx. 2-3 seconds to snap their neck by clicking the new 'grab' button that appears on one of your hand slots, otherwise they can escape by trying to move.

- You can pull/hide dead bodies by facing them and using the pull command. Bump into the body to release.

- Use 'S' and shadows to effectively slip into the shadows. Combine this with tranq. darts for long-range stunning.

- Short range stunning exist in screwdrivers and crowbars. Use to get away or in combination with snapping neck.

- Knifes disorient the target, greatly inhibiting their ability to walk.

- To get credit for a kill, and money, you must take the enemy's ID card. Bring it to your front desk of your agency, and 'say "kill" ' using the say command. You can also put this ID card in your ID slot, and gain access to their base and take on their name.

- Smokebombs are very effective when used correctly. Click a turf to throw the smokebomb when in hand, or click yourself to make the smoke follow you around. You will see through the smoke but enemies will not.
