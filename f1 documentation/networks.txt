Security Nodes/programs

Each terminal runs a system provided by a company (i.e. biostech v.3.9 or nanotrasen security v.3.0)

For each system, comes a package of programs that run different security devices around the area.
Simple/less complicated security devices require less quality systems with fewer options, but are also easier to hack than higher systems.

We're just strictly talking security. No relations to any computer databanks/servers right as of yet. The only relation is a security server - which lists all the systems installed. selecting a system will open up a list of terminals using that system. The computer database will use a specific system (high high tech) for all data. 

One last thing - the terminals controlling the security will have wireless signallers installed and run by programs. These are what send data to any wireless receiving device. More on that and playing with later.
