<p>What this proc does is set your agency/name to its real value, looks for an ID card worn and will switch your name/agency correspondingly. If you are cuffed,ko'ed,or below dead, your pulling is set to null and you drop any items you are holding.

It then goes through your variables to see what is in what slot, and refresh your screen.
It only deletes items on your screen that are in your mob, keep that in mind as it could cause for possible bugs in the future.
